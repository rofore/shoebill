< STILL EXPERIMENTAL! >

This fork of Shoebill builds on Apple Silicon and allows networking using Apple's VMNet (needs to be executed as root!). It also uses standard Quartz 2D to render the video output and _should_ (not tested!) work on retina and non-retina displays.

A Macintosh II emulator that runs A/UX (and A/UX only). 

Shoebill is an all-new, BSD-licensed Macintosh II emulator designed from the ground up with the singular goal of running A/UX. 

Shoebill requires a Macintosh II, IIx or IIcx ROM, and a disk image with A/UX installed.

__Update (March 29, 2023): About issues/pull requests__

__I just wanted to say that I appreciate some folks are still using Shoebill and submitting issues and pull requests. I wish I could continue working on this project, but there's a likely conflict of interest, and so I've mostly avoided pushing changes. I apologize for being unable to address the many, many bugs in this repo. (Also for anyone unaware, [Qemu is now able] now to run A/UX 3.x on its emulated Quadra 800.)__

__Update (Sept 13, 2015): [Shoebill 0.0.5 is available]__

__This will probably be the last release. I won't be able to work on Shoebill going forward (by contractual obligation), so I wanted to race out one last release. Only an OS X binary is available, sorry, and it's very unpolished. But the SDL GUI should still build on linux/windows.__
